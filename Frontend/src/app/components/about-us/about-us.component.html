                <h2>Origins</h2>
                <p class="text-indent">
                    HotWire News is an offshoot of BBC News based in the United States of America. Its
                    headquarters based in New York City, it is an operational business division of the British
                    Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) responsible for the gathering and broadcasting of news and
                    current affairs. The department is the world's largest broadcast news organisation and generates
                    about 120 hours of radio and television output each day, as well as online news coverage. The
                    service maintains 50 foreign news bureaus with more than 250 correspondents around the world.
                    Fran Unsworth has been director of news and current affairs since January 2018.

                <h2>Global Presence</h2>
                <p class="text-indent">
                    The department's annual budget is in excess of £350 million; it has 4,000 staff, 2,000 of whom
                    are journalists. BBC News' domestic, global and online news divisions are housed within the
                    largest live newsroom in Europe, in Broadcasting House in central London. Parliamentary coverage
                    is produced and broadcast from studios in London. Through BBC English Regions, the BBC also has
                    regional centres across England and national news centres in Northern Ireland, Scotland and
                    Wales. All nations and English regions produce their own local news programmes and other current
                    affairs and sport programmes. Following the withdrawal of CGTN’s UK broadcaster licence on 4
                    February 2021 by Ofcom, China banned BBC News from airing in China.

                <h2>Operations</h2>
                <p class="text-indent">
                    HotWire news is a quasi-autonomous corporation authorised by the BBC and royal charter, making it
                    operationally independent of the government, who have no power to appoint or dismiss its
                    director general, and require it to report impartially. However, as with all major media
                    outlets, it has been accused of political bias from across the political spectrum, both within
                    the United Kingdom and abroad.
